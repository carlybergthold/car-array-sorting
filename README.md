# Array Sorting: Car Sales

This practice involves a large JSON file with information on cars sold in the year 2017 at a fake dealership. I used array filtering methods to compile several reports on 2017 sales, like: 
-Total profit for 2017
-In which month did they sell the most cars?
-Which salesperson sold the most cars?
-Which salesperson made the most profit?
-Which model was the most popular?
-Which bank provided the most loans to our customers?
